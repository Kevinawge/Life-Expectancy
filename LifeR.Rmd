**Introduction**

### **Living Longer in a Changing World: A Data-Driven Analysis of Life Expectancy Trends**  

Life expectancy is a fundamental measure of human progress, reflecting advancements in healthcare, economic development, and environmental stability. Over the past century, improvements in medical technology, nutrition, and public health interventions have significantly increased global life expectancy. However, these gains have not been uniform across regions or socio-economic groups. While some countries have experienced dramatic improvements in longevity, others continue to face stagnation or even decline due to various health, economic, and environmental stressors. The disparities in life expectancy underscore the complexity of factors that contribute to human longevity, making it essential to adopt a data-driven approach to uncover underlying patterns and trends. This study leverages computational techniques to analyze how environmental, health-related, and socio-economic variables interact to shape life expectancy across different populations.

As the world undergoes rapid industrialization and urbanization, the interplay between environmental degradation and public health has become a pressing concern. Rising CO₂ emissions, deforestation, and urban expansion have been linked to deteriorating air quality, climate change, and increased disease prevalence. Countries with high levels of pollution and environmental degradation often report higher incidences of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to premature mortality. Simultaneously, rapid urbanization brings both opportunities and challenges, as it can drive economic growth but also strain healthcare infrastructure, increase population density, and contribute to new health risks. Understanding the long-term effects of environmental stressors on life expectancy requires an integrative approach that combines statistical modeling, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis.

Beyond environmental factors, the burden of disease plays a crucial role in shaping longevity outcomes. The global health landscape is characterized by a shift from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly in middle- and high-income nations. While infectious diseases remain a significant threat in low-income regions, conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer have become the leading causes of mortality in wealthier countries. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, air pollution, and occupational hazards, further contribute to this growing burden of chronic diseases. Additionally, injuries—ranging from road accidents to occupational hazards and violence—also influence mortality trends, particularly in countries experiencing conflict or weak safety regulations. By analyzing health indicators alongside environmental and economic variables, this study aims to quantify the role of disease burden in shaping life expectancy.

Economic disparities further complicate the relationship between health and longevity. Countries classified as high-income generally benefit from advanced healthcare systems, robust public health policies, and improved living conditions, all of which contribute to higher life expectancy. However, economic prosperity does not always equate to better health outcomes, as industrialization and urbanization introduce new risks such as pollution-related diseases, stress-related illnesses, and sedentary lifestyles. On the other hand, low-income nations continue to struggle with infectious diseases, malnutrition, and inadequate access to healthcare. These socio-economic disparities highlight the need for a nuanced analysis that accounts for income levels, healthcare accessibility, and regional variations in life expectancy.

The role of resource consumption in shaping health outcomes and longevity is another crucial consideration. Patterns of meat consumption, forest resource utilization, and land expansion may have indirect yet significant effects on population health. High meat consumption, for instance, is often associated with wealthier nations, but it has also been linked to increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Meanwhile, excessive deforestation and environmental exploitation may contribute to climate instability, food insecurity, and pollution, all of which can impact public health over time. The intersection of economic development and sustainability remains a key challenge for policymakers aiming to balance human well-being with environmental preservation.

Given the complexity of these interdependent factors, this research employs a rigorous data-driven methodology to analyze life expectancy trends across different regions and income groups. By integrating statistical techniques, machine learning models, and data visualization, we aim to identify key predictors of longevity and assess their relative importance in shaping global health outcomes. Unlike traditional epidemiological studies that focus on single-variable relationships, this approach allows us to capture multi-dimensional interactions and hidden patterns within large datasets. The insights gained from this analysis have the potential to inform evidence-based policy decisions, improve healthcare strategies, and foster sustainable development efforts aimed at enhancing life expectancy worldwide.

**Dataset**

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Read the dataset
full_life <- read_csv("full_life.csv")

# Remove first column (if necessary) and rename variables
full_life <- full_life %>%
  select(-1) %>%  # Remove first unnamed column
  rename(
    CountryCode = `Country Code`,  # Remove space
    LifeExpectancy = `Life Expectancy World Bank`,  # Rename to LifeExpectancy
    Undernourishment = `Prevalence of Undernourishment`  # Rename to Undernourishment
  )

# Save the cleaned dataset
write.csv(full_life, "final_life_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
The dataset at the core of this research provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the factors influencing life expectancy across various countries and years. It spans a wide range of economic, environmental, and health-related indicators, capturing the interplay between socio-economic status, pollution, disease burden, and resource consumption. With life expectancy as the dependent variable, this dataset allows for an in-depth exploration of how multiple independent variables contribute to longevity trends worldwide. By leveraging statistical methods and machine learning techniques, we can uncover patterns that traditional epidemiological studies may overlook, shedding light on the nuanced relationships between environmental degradation, disease prevalence, and economic disparities.

One of the critical environmental factors in this dataset is **CO₂ emissions**, measured in metric tons. These emissions vary significantly across countries, ranging from a few thousand tons in low-emission nations to billions of tons in industrialized economies. High CO₂ emissions are associated with poor air quality and increased exposure to pollutants, which contribute to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and overall public health deterioration. Additionally, **tree loss**, recorded in hectares, serves as an important environmental indicator, reflecting deforestation levels and their impact on air quality, carbon sequestration, and climate stability. Countries with high levels of deforestation may experience higher temperatures, reduced biodiversity, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events, indirectly influencing mortality rates.

The dataset also captures **urban expansion**, measured in hectares, which provides insight into how rapidly countries are developing and converting land for urban use. While urbanization is often linked to economic growth and improved healthcare infrastructure, it also introduces challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, and stress-related health conditions. Rapid urban expansion without corresponding investments in public health infrastructure may lead to increased exposure to diseases, higher accident rates, and decreased quality of life. Understanding how urbanization interacts with other variables, such as pollution and healthcare access, is crucial in determining its net impact on life expectancy.

Beyond environmental factors, the dataset includes critical **health indicators** that shape mortality trends. The variable **communicable diseases** measures the prevalence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and respiratory infections, which disproportionately affect low-income countries with limited healthcare resources. Conversely, **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)**, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer, are more prevalent in wealthier nations where lifestyle factors such as diet, air pollution, and stress play a significant role. Additionally, **injuries**, including accidents, workplace hazards, and violence, contribute to mortality in both developed and developing nations. By analyzing these health variables alongside economic and environmental factors, we can better understand how different disease burdens contribute to life expectancy disparities.

The economic aspect of the dataset is represented by **income group classifications**, which categorize countries based on their level of economic development. Higher-income countries tend to have greater access to advanced medical care, preventive healthcare, and social support systems, contributing to longer life expectancy. However, economic development also introduces health risks, such as pollution, lifestyle diseases, and mental health challenges. The dataset also includes **meat consumption**, measured in metric tons, which serves as a proxy for dietary patterns and economic development. While high meat consumption is often associated with wealthier nations, excessive consumption has been linked to health risks such as heart disease and obesity.

Two additional critical variables provide further insight into global health disparities. **Life expectancy (World Bank estimates)** serves as the primary dependent variable, offering a standardized measure of longevity across countries. This variable allows us to quantify how environmental, economic, and health-related factors influence mortality trends. Lastly, **undernourishment**, measured as the percentage of a country’s population experiencing insufficient food intake, provides a crucial lens into food security and malnutrition. Countries with high undernourishment rates often face increased infant mortality, weakened immune systems, and reduced life expectancy due to inadequate nutrition.

This dataset offers a robust foundation for applying data science techniques to uncover the determinants of human longevity. By employing exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical inference, this study seeks to quantify the relative influence of various factors on life expectancy. The breadth and complexity of this dataset enable a holistic investigation into how environmental, economic, and health-related variables intersect to shape human longevity. The next sections will delve deeper into each category, exploring the extent to which these factors influence global life expectancy trends.

**Environmental and Urbanization Factors Affecting Life Expectancy**

As industrialization and urban expansion continue to reshape the global landscape, the impact of environmental changes on public health and longevity has become a critical area of study. Rising CO₂ emissions, large-scale deforestation, and rapid urbanization have transformed ecosystems and altered atmospheric conditions, contributing to increased respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and other health complications. In many developing nations, urban expansion outpaces infrastructure development, leading to overcrowding, pollution, and inadequate healthcare services—factors that collectively contribute to reduced life expectancy. Conversely, well-planned urbanization can provide access to better healthcare, improved sanitation, and economic opportunities that enhance longevity. The complex interplay between environmental and urbanization factors presents a challenge for policymakers aiming to balance economic growth with sustainability and public health outcomes.

Deforestation and air pollution, often driven by industrial activities and land-use changes, have cascading effects on human health. As forests are cleared for agriculture, construction, and resource extraction, carbon sequestration decreases, leading to higher greenhouse gas concentrations. Additionally, tree loss exacerbates soil degradation, disrupts local weather patterns, and increases exposure to extreme climate events such as heat waves and floods. The long-term consequences of environmental degradation extend beyond immediate health impacts; they influence food security, water availability, and economic stability—each of which plays a role in determining life expectancy trends. Analyzing these factors from a data-driven perspective enables us to quantify their effects and identify potential intervention strategies to mitigate adverse outcomes.

To better understand the relationship between economic development and environmental impact, we analyze CO₂ emissions across income groups using a boxplot visualization. CO₂ emissions are a significant contributor to climate change and air pollution, both of which are known to affect human health and, ultimately, life expectancy. This graph categorizes countries into four income groups—low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income—and examines the distribution of CO₂ emissions within each group. By employing a logarithmic scale, we can observe the variance in emissions levels more effectively, allowing for better identification of trends and outliers. The inclusion of median values for each income category provides a clearer understanding of the central tendency, helping to quantify the disparity in emissions between different economic classes.

# Read the dataset
df <- read.csv("final_life_data.csv")

# Clean dataset: Remove zero or negative CO₂ emissions and ensure IncomeGroup is categorical
df_clean <- df %>%
  filter(Co2emissions > 0) %>%
  mutate(IncomeGroup = factor(IncomeGroup, levels = c("Low income", "Lower middle income", "Upper middle income", "High income")))

# Create the improved boxplot with refinements
ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = IncomeGroup, y = Co2emissions, fill = IncomeGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.alpha = 0.3, outlier.color = "black") +  # Adjust transparency of outliers
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +  # Log transformation with better labels
  stat_summary(fun = median, geom = "text", aes(label = round(..y.., 2)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5, color = "black") + # Add median values
  labs(title = "CO2 Emissions Across Income Groups",
       x = "Income Group",
       y = "CO2 Emissions (Million Metric Tons)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove redundant legend



```
The boxplot reveals a notable pattern: **higher-income countries generally exhibit greater CO₂ emissions**, as indicated by their higher median values. The median CO₂ emissions for **high-income countries** are approximately **5.09 million metric tons**, while **upper-middle-income nations** have a median of **2.39 million metric tons**. In contrast, **lower-middle-income countries** and **low-income countries** report median emissions of **3.49 million metric tons** and **4.48 million metric tons**, respectively. This aligns with expectations, as industrialized economies rely heavily on fossil fuel consumption, transportation, and large-scale manufacturing, all of which significantly contribute to emissions. However, the **wide interquartile ranges (IQRs) and numerous outliers** within each income group indicate substantial variability. Some **upper-middle-income** nations exhibit emissions that rival or even exceed those of high-income nations, likely due to **rapid industrialization without strict environmental policies**.  

Interestingly, the **presence of numerous outliers in the lower-income groups** suggests that some developing countries have disproportionately high emissions relative to their economic standing. These extreme values could be attributed to countries with economies heavily reliant on **extractive industries**, such as coal production or large-scale deforestation, contributing to emissions despite their lower GDP. The lowest observed emissions in the dataset are **close to 1,000 metric tons**, while the highest outliers surpass **1 billion metric tons**, emphasizing the drastic disparity between nations. Conversely, some **high-income nations exhibit relatively lower emissions**, potentially reflecting **strong environmental regulations, investment in renewable energy, or efficiency improvements in industrial processes**. This analysis highlights the complex relationship between **economic growth, environmental sustainability, and public health**, reinforcing the urgent need for **sustainable urbanization strategies** that balance industrial expansion with policies that minimize health risks associated with pollution and climate change.

While CO₂ emissions serve as a key indicator of industrialization and pollution, they are not the sole environmental factor influencing life expectancy. Deforestation, measured as tree loss, plays a crucial role in global carbon cycles and air quality. As forests are cleared for agriculture, urban expansion, and resource extraction, their ability to absorb CO₂ diminishes, leading to higher atmospheric carbon concentrations and worsening climate conditions. In regions with high deforestation, rising temperatures and declining air quality can contribute to increased rates of respiratory diseases, heat stress, and food insecurity, all of which can impact longevity. To better understand the relationship between deforestation and CO₂ emissions, we analyze a scatter plot to determine whether countries with higher tree loss also exhibit higher emissions levels. This visualization will help us assess whether industrial expansion and deforestation are directly linked or if other factors influence this environmental relationship.

cor_value <- cor(df_clean$Treeloss, df_clean$Co2emissions, method = "pearson")

# Create scatter plot with regression line and correlation annotation
ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = Treeloss, y = Co2emissions)) +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Regression line without confidence interval
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +  # Log scale with readable labels
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +  
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Tree Loss and CO2 Emissions",
       subtitle = paste("Correlation Coefficient (R²):", round(cor_value^2, 3)),
       x = "Tree Loss (Million Hectares)",
       y = "CO2 Emissions (Million Metric Tons)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none")  # Center title and remove legend

```

The scatter plot reveals a **strong positive correlation (R² = 0.931) between tree loss and CO₂ emissions**, indicating that as deforestation increases, so do carbon emissions. This high R² value suggests that **93.1% of the variance in CO₂ emissions** can be explained by tree loss, highlighting a direct relationship between deforestation and increased atmospheric carbon levels. Countries experiencing tree loss on the scale of **millions of hectares per year** tend to have significantly higher emissions, with values surpassing **1 billion metric tons of CO₂** in extreme cases. The log-log transformation of both axes helps to visualize this trend across countries with varying levels of deforestation, from those with minimal tree loss to those undergoing large-scale land conversion for agriculture, industry, or urban development.  

A closer look at the data suggests that even countries with relatively **moderate levels of tree loss (~0.01M hectares per year)** still contribute significantly to CO₂ emissions, often in the range of **millions of metric tons annually**. This implies that while large-scale deforestation is a major driver of emissions, even smaller-scale deforestation can have measurable environmental consequences. The near-perfect linearity of the trend suggests that policy interventions focused on **reducing deforestation rates could significantly impact global emissions levels**, particularly in regions where forest loss is occurring at an accelerating rate. These findings reinforce the need for **sustainable land management policies** to mitigate the dual threats of climate change and declining air quality, both of which are known contributors to decreased life expectancy.

While environmental degradation is a global issue, some nations contribute disproportionately to CO₂ emissions, making them primary drivers of climate change. Industrialized economies with heavy reliance on fossil fuels, manufacturing, and large-scale energy production tend to dominate CO₂ emissions rankings, often far exceeding emissions levels in developing nations. These emissions have profound impacts on air quality, global temperatures, and human health, all of which directly influence life expectancy.

To better understand which countries contribute the most to global CO₂ emissions, we present a pie chart showcasing the top 5 CO₂-emitting countries. This visualization will help illustrate the relative share of emissions among the biggest polluters, highlighting where mitigation efforts should be concentrated. By breaking down emissions contributions, we can identify whether the global carbon footprint is driven primarily by a few large economies or distributed more evenly among many nations.

  head(5)  # Select top 10 countries

# Compute percentage values separately
top_co2_countries <- top_co2_countries %>%
  mutate(Percentage = round(Total_CO2 / sum(Total_CO2) * 100, 1),
         Label = paste0(Country, "\n", Percentage, "%"))  # Label with country name & percentage

```
The interactive pie chart clearly highlights the disproportionate contribution of certain countries to global CO₂ emissions. **Brazil leads with 39.2% of total emissions** among the top five, indicating its significant role in environmental impact, likely driven by large-scale deforestation in the Amazon and extensive industrial activities. **Indonesia follows closely at 28.4%**, reflecting the massive deforestation practices for palm oil production and land-use changes contributing to high emissions. **Canada, at 22.7%**, is a notable outlier among developed nations, likely due to its reliance on fossil fuel extraction, including oil sands operations, which are among the most carbon-intensive energy sources. Meanwhile, **Malaysia (6.76%) and Colombia (2.92%)** contribute smaller but still significant shares, pointing to the role of expanding urbanization, logging, and resource extraction in these regions. The dominance of **Brazil and Indonesia**, together contributing to over two-thirds of the emissions in this subset, emphasizes the urgent need for deforestation control and sustainable land management strategies in these tropical regions. The **steep decline in emissions percentages among the lower-ranked contributors** suggests that while multiple countries contribute to the global carbon footprint, a handful of nations are disproportionately responsible, reinforcing the need for targeted climate policies and international cooperation to mitigate the long-term environmental impact.

While visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of environmental impact, numerical summaries and statistical correlations offer deeper insights into the underlying relationships between key variables. By computing descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range, we can better understand the distribution and variability of CO₂ emissions, tree loss, and urban expansion across different countries. This allows us to quantify the scale of environmental changes and identify potential outliers or regions experiencing extreme ecological shifts.

Beyond individual distributions, correlation analysis is essential in understanding how these environmental factors interact. CO₂ emissions, tree loss, and urban expansion do not operate in isolation—changes in one may drive fluctuations in another. Moreover, the relationship between these environmental variables and life expectancy is of particular interest, as higher pollution and deforestation rates may be linked to reduced longevity due to health hazards such as air pollution and climate-related illnesses. By computing a correlation matrix, we can determine which factors have the strongest statistical associations, helping to identify key drivers of environmental and health outcomes. The following analysis presents summary statistics of these variables, followed by an exploration of their interdependencies through correlation analysis.

The descriptive statistics provide a quantitative snapshot of the environmental and socioeconomic variables influencing life expectancy. **CO₂ emissions** show a mean value of **44,992,884.54 metric tons**, but with an extremely high standard deviation of **190,164,695.00**, indicating significant variability across countries. The maximum CO₂ emissions recorded in a single case reach **3.27 billion metric tons**, highlighting the disproportionate contribution of a few heavily industrialized nations. Similarly, **tree loss** presents a mean value of **98,588.83 hectares**, but its standard deviation (**374,492.69 hectares**) suggests considerable variation, with the highest value reaching over **5.56 million hectares** in extreme cases. This reinforces the idea that deforestation is not evenly distributed but rather concentrated in certain regions, likely due to large-scale agricultural, logging, or urban expansion activities.

Urban expansion also exhibits notable dispersion, with an average of **421,786.47 square kilometers** and a standard deviation of **216,910.52 square kilometers**, suggesting that while some areas experience minimal growth, others undergo substantial land-use changes. The highest recorded urban expansion surpasses **1.11 million square kilometers**, reinforcing concerns about rapid urbanization and its potential environmental impacts. In contrast, **life expectancy** shows relatively lower variability, with an average of **69.00 years** and a standard deviation of **9.87 years**. The maximum life expectancy observed is **83.98 years**, suggesting that some countries achieve notably higher longevity, likely due to superior healthcare systems, lower environmental degradation, and better living conditions. The wide discrepancies across these variables underscore the need for further analysis into their relationships and the role of policy interventions in mitigating adverse environmental effects on public health.

**Health and Disease Burden on Life Expectancy**

As global health landscapes evolve, the primary drivers of mortality have shifted from **communicable diseases** to **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** such as cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and cancer. While infectious diseases remain a major concern in lower-income countries, wealthier nations experience a higher prevalence of chronic conditions that impact long-term health. Additionally, **injuries from accidents, occupational hazards, and violence** play a significant role in shaping mortality trends, particularly in regions with poor healthcare access or high-risk working environments. Understanding how these health burdens contribute to variations in life expectancy is essential for designing targeted public health policies.  

Beyond disease prevalence, **malnutrition and food security** are critical determinants of health outcomes. The prevalence of **undernourishment** directly affects immune function, making populations more vulnerable to infections and chronic conditions. Nutritional deficiencies are especially concerning in lower-income nations where food scarcity exacerbates existing health challenges. By analyzing how different disease burdens—infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, injuries, and undernutrition—correlate with life expectancy, we can gain deeper insights into **the global disparities in health and longevity**.

To better understand how different health burdens impact life expectancy, we begin by examining the relationship between communicable and non-communicable diseases across various countries. While communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, remain a dominant cause of mortality in lower-income nations, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular disease and diabetes are the primary contributors to death in wealthier regions. This shift reflects improvements in infectious disease control but also highlights the growing challenge of lifestyle-related illnesses.

The following density plot visualizes the distribution of communicable and non-communicable disease prevalence, helping us identify whether certain health conditions are more common in specific economic or geographic contexts. The density curves allow us to compare how different disease burdens are distributed across nations, offering insights into global health trends.

```
The density plot provides a **comparative analysis of the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases** across different populations, revealing distinct distribution patterns. The **log transformation** was applied to disease prevalence per 100,000 people to mitigate the impact of extreme values, ensuring a more interpretable visualization. The **peak prevalence of communicable diseases** occurs around **10⁵ to 10⁶ cases per 100,000 people**, highlighting regions where infectious diseases remain a significant public health burden. In contrast, **non-communicable diseases exhibit a higher peak density, ranging from 10⁶ to 10⁷ cases**, indicating their growing dominance in global health burdens. This suggests that as countries develop, the shift from infectious to chronic illnesses becomes evident, reflecting epidemiological transition theories. Additionally, the density overlap between **10⁵ and 10⁷ cases** suggests that in certain regions, both disease types contribute significantly to mortality, reinforcing the need for **dual-focused health interventions**. The sharp decline in density beyond **10⁷ cases** for both categories indicates that extremely high disease prevalence remains relatively rare, possibly due to **interventions, medical advancements, or data limitations** in regions with extreme cases. These findings underscore the **growing burden of non-communicable diseases in high-income nations** while reaffirming the **persistent threat of infectious diseases in lower-income regions**, highlighting the critical role of healthcare access and preventive measures in shaping life expectancy trends.

Undernourishment plays a critical role in shaping global health disparities. Countries with higher rates of food insecurity often experience shortened life expectancy due to malnutrition-related illnesses, increased disease burden, and limited access to healthcare. By analyzing undernourishment across different income groups, we can better understand how economic status affects nutritional well-being and longevity. This visualization provides insights into whether wealthier nations consistently have higher life expectancy and how food insecurity contributes to mortality gaps worldwide.

```

The violin plot provides an insightful visualization of how **undernourishment impacts life expectancy** across different income groups. The distribution clearly highlights the disparity in life expectancy between **high-income and low-income groups**, reinforcing the well-documented link between socioeconomic status and health outcomes. **High-income countries** exhibit a **tight distribution** of life expectancy values centered around **75 to 85 years**, with minimal variability, suggesting that populations in these nations experience stable, long, and healthy lives. In stark contrast, **low-income countries** display a much **broader and more dispersed distribution**, with life expectancy values ranging from approximately **40 to 70 years**. This indicates significant variation in health outcomes within these regions, likely driven by **access to healthcare, nutrition, and disease prevalence**. Additionally, the **lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income groups** demonstrate intermediate distributions, though with wider variance than high-income groups, reflecting a transition phase in health improvements as economies develop. The presence of outliers, particularly in the **low-income category**, suggests that some countries perform better than their economic classification might predict, possibly due to **targeted public health interventions** or **localized improvements in food security and medical infrastructure**. The violin shape in each category also indicates **skewness in life expectancy**, where **low-income nations tend to have a left-skewed distribution**, meaning a higher concentration of individuals with lower life expectancy. This pattern aligns with global trends showing that **poverty, food insecurity, and limited access to quality healthcare are major contributors to premature mortality**. Overall, this visualization underscores the necessity for **policy interventions** aimed at **reducing global food insecurity**, enhancing **public health infrastructure**, and promoting **socioeconomic equity** to bridge the gap in life expectancy between wealthier and poorer nations.

Building upon the insights gained from the violin plot, which illustrated how undernourishment impacts life expectancy across income groups, it is crucial to analyze the broader disease burden and its role in shaping mortality trends. While food security plays a major role in determining health outcomes, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries remain the leading contributors to mortality worldwide. Understanding how these factors interact with life expectancy can help policymakers prioritize interventions, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted health initiatives. This summary aims to move beyond simple descriptive statistics and instead focuses on identifying relationships and disparities among different disease categories. By exploring correlation patterns, ranking distributions, and the relative contribution of disease types to mortality, we can gain deeper insights into how health burdens vary across populations and what strategies might mitigate their impact.

```
The results of the multiple linear regression model reveal significant insights into how different types of disease burdens influence life expectancy. The intercept of **68.91** suggests that in the absence of disease-related burdens, the expected life expectancy would be around **69 years**, aligning with global trends in regions with lower disease prevalence. The coefficient for **communicable diseases** is **-4.07e-07**, indicating a **negative relationship** with life expectancy, meaning that as the prevalence of communicable diseases increases, life expectancy decreases. With a **t-value of -19.93** and a **p-value < 2e-16**, this effect is highly significant, reinforcing the well-documented impact of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV in reducing life expectancy, particularly in lower-income regions where healthcare access is limited. On the other hand, the coefficient for **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** is **4.46e-07**, which, although counterintuitive, suggests that these diseases tend to be more prevalent in high-income countries where life expectancy is already longer. The **t-value of 9.81** and **p-value < 2e-16** confirm that this effect is statistically significant, highlighting how chronic diseases like cardiovascular issues and diabetes typically affect older populations, contributing to mortality later in life rather than drastically reducing average life expectancy. The coefficient for **injuries** is **-2.82e-07**, but its **t-value of -1.31** and **p-value of 0.19** suggest that it is not statistically significant, indicating that injuries, while impactful on individual mortality, do not substantially affect overall life expectancy when compared to disease prevalence. The **Multiple R-squared value of 0.2054** and **Adjusted R-squared of 0.2042** suggest that the model explains about **20.5% of the variance in life expectancy**, which, while moderate, indicates that other factors—such as **economic conditions, healthcare access, nutrition, and environmental influences**—play a significant role in determining life expectancy. The **Residual Standard Error of 8.804** suggests some variability in the model's predictions, while the **F-statistic of 172.3** with a **p-value < 2.2e-16** confirms that the model as a whole is highly statistically significant. These findings emphasize the critical role of reducing **communicable disease prevalence** in improving life expectancy, as these conditions continue to disproportionately affect lower-income populations with limited healthcare infrastructure. Meanwhile, the positive association of non-communicable diseases with life expectancy suggests that as nations develop and people live longer, chronic conditions become more dominant causes of mortality. This analysis underscores the need for **targeted healthcare policies** that address both **infectious disease control in lower-income regions** and the **management of chronic diseases in aging populations**, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and longevity worldwide.

**Economic, Regional, and Lifestyle Factors in Life Expectancy**

**Economic, Regional, and Lifestyle Factors in Life Expectancy**  

Understanding the economic, regional, and lifestyle factors that influence life expectancy is crucial in identifying the broader systemic forces shaping global health outcomes. While medical advancements and disease control play a significant role in extending lifespan, factors such as income levels, access to resources, environmental conditions, and lifestyle choices create substantial disparities in how long people live. Economic prosperity often correlates with improved healthcare systems, better nutrition, and enhanced living conditions, while regions with lower economic development frequently experience higher mortality rates due to malnutrition, inadequate medical infrastructure, and environmental stressors. The distribution of resources, including food, clean water, and forest conservation, also plays a vital role in sustaining public health, as environmental degradation and resource depletion can have long-term consequences on both individual well-being and societal stability. Furthermore, urban expansion and industrialization shape living conditions in complex ways—offering economic opportunities and improved healthcare access in some areas while exacerbating pollution, overcrowding, and lifestyle diseases in others. Examining these variables is essential in crafting policies that promote sustainable development, reduce health disparities, and ensure that longer, healthier lives are not just a privilege of wealthier nations but a reality for all populations. By analyzing these interconnected factors, we gain a deeper understanding of how economic decisions, regional inequalities, and lifestyle behaviors contribute to life expectancy trends, ultimately guiding more effective public health and development strategies.

```
The **choropleth map of global life expectancy distribution** provides a compelling visual representation of the disparities in longevity across different regions. High-income countries, particularly in **North America, Western Europe, and Australia**, exhibit the **highest life expectancy rates**, typically exceeding **80 years**. This aligns with well-documented trends where advanced healthcare infrastructure, widespread access to medical services, and higher living standards contribute to increased life expectancy. These nations also tend to have lower rates of communicable diseases, better maternal and child healthcare, and more comprehensive social support systems, all of which are pivotal in sustaining longer lifespans. In contrast, regions such as **Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia** display **significantly lower life expectancy, often below 60 years**. These areas are characterized by persistent health challenges, including **high infant mortality rates, prevalence of infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS), poor healthcare access, and food insecurity**. The stark contrast between these regions and their wealthier counterparts underscores the profound impact of economic conditions, healthcare access, and government policies on population health outcomes.

Additionally, the **variation in life expectancy within middle-income regions** such as **Latin America, Central Asia, and parts of the Middle East** suggests a more complex interplay between economic development and health improvements. While some countries within these regions have achieved **moderate life expectancy gains (70–75 years)**, others lag behind due to **inequities in healthcare distribution, environmental factors, and dietary patterns**. For example, **countries with high reliance on extractive industries or experiencing environmental degradation may face health risks from pollution and poor air quality**, which can negatively impact longevity. Furthermore, the **impact of lifestyle and diet**, such as **high levels of meat consumption and forest resource depletion**, may contribute to disparities in mortality rates, which will be explored in later analyses. The map’s visualization emphasizes the critical need for **global public health interventions, economic investment in healthcare systems, and policies that address both infectious and non-communicable diseases**. As economic and technological advancements continue to reshape healthcare landscapes, understanding these regional differences can inform strategies aimed at reducing health disparities and improving life expectancy worldwide.

```
The histogram provides a comparative analysis of **meat consumption and forest resource utilization** in relation to life expectancy by illustrating the frequency of observations across different consumption/utilization levels. The distribution indicates that **meat consumption (blue) tends to be more evenly distributed** across the lower range of the utilization scale, while **forest resource utilization (red) has a more sporadic pattern**, with some peaks at higher levels. The general **overlapping of both factors suggests a potential interaction between dietary habits and environmental sustainability**, where regions with **higher meat consumption may also be linked to a moderate level of forest resource utilization**. This could reflect the agricultural dependencies of certain economies—countries with high meat consumption often rely on deforestation for livestock farming, while others with **lower meat consumption may have a different economic structure** with less environmental degradation. Additionally, **higher peaks in both variables at lower consumption levels suggest that most observations fall within a moderate range of utilization**, with fewer cases showing extreme levels of either variable.

From a broader perspective, this visualization raises important questions about **the sustainability of resource consumption and its impact on health outcomes**. If **higher meat consumption correlates positively with life expectancy**, this could be due to the **nutritional benefits** associated with increased protein intake in wealthier nations. Conversely, excessive **forest resource utilization may indicate environmental degradation, which could have indirect negative effects on longevity**, such as **increased pollution, reduced biodiversity, and climate change impacts**. The presence of **outliers at higher utilization levels** suggests that in some cases, either extreme deforestation or exceptionally high meat consumption occurs, potentially driven by **industrial-scale agriculture or economic necessity**. Future research could explore **how these consumption patterns affect public health outcomes**, particularly in regions where **food security and environmental policies are in conflict**.

Building upon the previous analysis of resource consumption and its implications on life expectancy, we now shift our focus to the role of urban expansion and economic classification in shaping longevity trends. The stacked bar chart illustrates the distribution of life expectancy across different economic groups, segmented by distinct life expectancy ranges. Notably, we observe that the majority of the population across all economic groups falls within the 60-80 year life expectancy range, with slight variations in distribution. The low and lower-middle-income groups show a higher proportion of individuals in the 50-60 and 60-70 range, indicating that economic constraints may limit access to healthcare, sanitation, and other critical determinants of longevity. Meanwhile, the upper-middle and high-income groups have a relatively larger proportion of individuals reaching 70-90 years of life expectancy, emphasizing the role of wealth in extending lifespan through better healthcare infrastructure, reduced environmental stressors, and improved nutrition.

```
The faceted bar chart presents a comparative analysis of life expectancy distribution across different economic groups, offering valuable insights into the disparities in longevity among various income levels. A clear pattern emerges, where high-income and upper-middle-income countries exhibit a greater proportion of individuals falling into the **70-80 and 80-90 life expectancy ranges**, indicating that wealthier nations generally benefit from longer lifespans due to access to advanced healthcare, better nutrition, and improved living conditions. Conversely, **low-income and lower-middle-income groups show a higher prevalence of individuals in the 50-60 and 60-70 life expectancy ranges**, reinforcing the well-documented correlation between economic constraints and reduced longevity. The presence of individuals within the **40-50 range**, particularly in the lower economic brackets, suggests that limited healthcare access, higher disease burdens, and environmental stressors continue to pose significant challenges in these regions. Interestingly, despite the expected trend of increasing life expectancy with rising economic status, the **distribution within some middle-income groups suggests variability**, potentially influenced by factors such as rapid urbanization, pollution, and regional healthcare disparities. These findings highlight the **critical role of economic development in shaping health outcomes**, emphasizing the need for **targeted public health interventions and policies aimed at reducing global disparities in life expectancy**.

```
The statistical summary of our linear regression model provides valuable insights into the relationship between **urban expansion, resource consumption, and life expectancy**. The intercept value of **70.99** suggests that, in the absence of the independent variables, the expected life expectancy hovers around 71 years. However, the regression coefficients for **Urban Expansion (-0.0015), Meat Consumption (-0.0179), and Forest Utilization (-0.0058)** indicate negative associations with life expectancy, meaning that an increase in any of these factors slightly correlates with a decrease in predicted life expectancy. Despite these observed trends, none of the independent variables exhibit **statistical significance**, as their **p-values (Urban Expansion: 0.92, Meat Consumption: 0.22, Forest Utilization: 0.70) exceed the conventional 0.05 threshold**. This suggests that, while these factors may play a role in shaping life expectancy, their impact is not strong enough to be deemed statistically significant within this dataset. 

One potential explanation for these results is the presence of **confounding variables** or **nonlinear interactions** that are not accounted for in this model. For example, while increased meat consumption may be associated with higher mortality due to **diet-related diseases**, it is also linked to greater economic prosperity, which in turn improves **healthcare access and overall longevity**. Similarly, **urban expansion** can have both **positive and negative implications**—on one hand, it drives infrastructure and healthcare advancements, yet on the other, it contributes to **pollution, overcrowding, and stress-related illnesses**. The lack of significance in forest utilization could be attributed to **regional disparities in how forest resources are managed**—some nations may use forests sustainably, whereas others exploit them at the cost of environmental and human health. Moving forward, improving the model by incorporating **additional socioeconomic and environmental indicators**, interaction terms, or a **nonlinear regression approach** may help uncover deeper insights into these complex relationships.

**Predictive Analysis: Modeling Life Expectancy Trends in Japan**

Understanding and predicting life expectancy trends is a critical component of data-driven public health and policy planning. In this analysis, we focus specifically on life expectancy in Japan, utilizing advanced statistical modeling to examine past trends and forecast future outcomes. By isolating a single country, we are able to apply a more focused and granular approach, minimizing cross-country variability and allowing for more precise model calibration. The methodology centers around the application of the Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS), a powerful forecasting technique well-suited for time series data that exhibit trend and level components but lack clear seasonality. This model was trained on historical life expectancy values to learn the underlying structure of the trend over time. Through this process, we generated a ten-year forecast complete with 95% and 99% confidence intervals, providing a robust estimate of future longevity in Japan. The ETS model's smooth predictions and interpretable structure make it a compelling tool for policy advisors, demographers, and health economists seeking to anticipate demographic shifts and healthcare needs. This country-specific application illustrates how time series forecasting can be harnessed to inform evidence-based decision making and long-term planning at the national level.

The results of the ETS model applied to Japan's life expectancy data reveal several important insights with both statistical and practical implications. The forecast visualization indicates a clear and steady upward trend in life expectancy, reflecting continued improvements in health outcomes, longevity, and potentially the impact of Japan’s robust healthcare infrastructure and aging-friendly policies. Over the ten-year forecast horizon, the predicted life expectancy increases from just over 84 years to slightly above 85.1 years, suggesting a continued extension of life spans under current conditions. What makes this model particularly valuable is the inclusion of probabilistic forecasting in the form of confidence intervals. For example, the second year of the forecast yields a point estimate of approximately 84.16 years, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 83.83 to 84.50 and a 99% confidence interval from 83.72 to 84.61. These intervals are statistically meaningful—they imply that we can be 95% or 99% confident, respectively, that the true life expectancy will fall within those bounds. The relatively narrow width of these intervals also speaks to the stability and reliability of the ETS model in this context. It captures the inherent uncertainty in time series forecasting while still providing actionable, bounded projections. Moreover, the widening of the confidence bands over time—clearly visible in the plotted forecast—demonstrates how forecast uncertainty grows the further we move from the known historical data, which is an expected and interpretable property of well-calibrated predictive models. This not only validates the ETS model’s behavior but also underscores its applicability in realistic policy and planning scenarios. Overall, the results confirm that ETS is not only a statistically sound approach for forecasting life expectancy in Japan but also a practical one, capable of offering decision-makers both clarity and caution as they prepare for future demographic shifts.
