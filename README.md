# Life Expectancy Analysis Project

This project investigates life expectancy trends across the globe using data analysis techniques in R. It focuses on understanding how variables such as income level, geographic region, and time influence life expectancy outcomes. By combining statistical summaries and visualizations, the analysis highlights disparities between countries and regions, shedding light on inequalities in global health.

The report explores both historical patterns and the relationship between life expectancy and socioeconomic indicators. Using regression models, the project evaluates which factors are most strongly associated with longer lifespans.

In the final section, the project takes a forward-looking approach by building predictive models to estimate future life expectancy values. This predictive component demonstrates how historical data can be leveraged to inform decisions about global health trends and public policy planning.
